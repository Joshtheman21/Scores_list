This python list was actually fun to mess around with considering it's very new to me right now. 
I read in 5-6 numbers in my input and from there I did the average score, the numbers from lowest to highest..vice versa, the lowest number, the highest number, and where the lowest and highest number appear at in the index list.
Also, I used the coding platform THONNY
